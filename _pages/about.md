I am an PhD student in Computer Science at [Indiana University (IUB)](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by [Prof. Thai Le](https://lethaiq.github.io/tql3/). My research focuses on developing interpretable and principled methods to improve the efficiency, reasoning capability, and safety of large language models (LLMs).

<!-- My research interest lies in the intersection of Interpretability and Explainablity of large-scale models. -->
